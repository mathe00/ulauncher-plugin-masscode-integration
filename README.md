# 📄 Ulauncher Plugin/Extension MassCode Integration

👋 **Welcome to the Ulauncher Plugin/Extension MassCode Integration repository!**

This plugin/extension allows you to easily access your **[MassCode](https://masscode.io) snippets** directly from **[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io)**. No need to manually open MassCode or browse through folders to find your snippets anymore. Just type the snippet name or part of it in Ulauncher, and boom – access it instantly! 🚀

## 🚀 Features Available

- 🔍 **Quick snippet search**: Type a keyword in Ulauncher to search through your MassCode snippets.
- 📂 **Choose database path**: You can specify the path to the JSON file containing your MassCode snippets.
- 📄 **Snippet preview**: View the content of your snippets directly in Ulauncher.
- ⏩ **Quick access**: Choose between copying the snippet to your clipboard or pasting it directly (okay, the pasting option isn’t functional yet, but one day... maybe?).

## ✨ New: Ulauncher Plugin/Extension Text Tools

If you're interested in more text transformations, check out my latest **[Text Tools plugin/extension](https://github.com/mathe00/ulauncher-plugin-text-tools)**! This new extension allows you to transform any input text into various formats such as Uppercase, CamelCase, Snake Case, and even SpongeBob Case (yes, that's a thing!). You can easily toggle these transformations from the Ulauncher settings, making it a super versatile and complete tool for text manipulation. 💡

## 🛠️ Contributing

I’ve got to be honest – this plugin/extension was developed mostly thanks to **ChatGPT** helping me along the way! 😅 I haven’t actively developed it much recently because, well, it works for me, and I’m lazy. But, I’m also a huge fan of **features and customization**, so I’m always open to **feedback, recommendations, and pull requests**.

I built this for myself, but I figured others might also find it useful. So here it is, shared with the world. 🌍

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have ideas on how to improve it. Contributions are always welcome!

Oh, and **English isn’t my first language**, so I apologize if I misunderstand something or take a bit longer to respond to issues or pull requests 😅. Thanks for your patience!

## ⚖️ License

I’ve added the **MIT License** because it’s the most permissive and simple, but I’m not 100% sure it’s the right one for this project. If there’s a different license I should be using (especially regarding **Ulauncher** or **MassCode**), **please let me know**! I definitely don’t want to cause any issues with these amazing tools – I just want to share what I’ve built in case it helps others. 😊

## 🙏 Special Thanks

A huge shout-out to the amazing developers of **[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io)** – hands down, the best application launcher in the universe for Linux! 🚀 You guys rock! And a big thank you to the team behind **[MassCode](https://masscode.io)** for building such a cool and powerful snippet manager. You’ve made coding life so much easier!

## ⭐ Show Your Support

I’m not really concerned about the number of stars, but if you find this project useful or interesting, consider giving it a star on GitHub to help me gauge the interest. If you’d rather not leave a star, that’s totally fine – feel free to open an issue, submit a pull request, or even drop a message of support in an issue instead!
